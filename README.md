# How to Upload an Excel File and Bind to Blazor DataGrid

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to upload an Excel workbook and bind the imported data to the Syncfusion Blazor DataGrid. The application reads spreadsheet content from an uploaded Excel file, converts the worksheet data into a format suitable for data binding, and displays the imported records within the DataGrid. This approach is useful in scenarios where users need to load external spreadsheet data into a web application for viewing, filtering, sorting, or further processing without requiring a database import step.

## Key Features

- Demonstrates Excel file upload within a Blazor application.
- Reads spreadsheet data from a user-selected Excel workbook.
- Imports worksheet records and prepares them for DataGrid binding.
- Dynamically updates the Syncfusion Blazor DataGrid using uploaded Excel data.
- Illustrates an Excel-to-DataGrid workflow without requiring a preconfigured database.
- Includes framework-specific implementations for both .NET 5 and .NET 7 sample projects.
- Provides a practical example of loading external spreadsheet content into a web-based grid interface.
- Demonstrates client-side data presentation after successful Excel processing and import.
